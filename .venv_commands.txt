Virtual Environment
It is suggested to have a dedicated virtual environment for each Django project, and one way to manage a virtual environment is venv, which is included in Python.

The name of the virtual environment is your choice, in this tutorial we will call it .venv.

Type the following in the command prompt, remember to navigate to where you want to create your project:

Windows:
py -m venv .venv

Unix/MacOS:
python -m venv .venv

This will set up a virtual environment, and create a folder named ".venv" with subfolders and files, like this:

myworld
  Include
  Lib
  Scripts
  pyvenv.cfg
Then you have to activate the environment, by typing this command:

Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

Unix/MacOS:
source .venv/bin/activate

Once the environment is activated, you will see this result in the command prompt:

Windows:
(.venv) C:\Users\Your Name>

Unix/MacOS:
(.venv) ... $

Note: You must activate the virtual environment every time you open the command prompt to work on your project.
